1. Load data and create you input and output tables.
Answer:
import pandas as pd
music= pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosh-hamedani/python-supplementary-materials/refs/heads/main/music.csv')
X = music.drop(columns=['genre'])
y = music['genre']

2. Create an algorithum that gives the predicted genre a 21 year old male and a 22 year old female would possible be into based on the data.
Answer:
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
predictions= model.predict([ [21, 1], [22, 0] ])
predictions
-Output: array(['HipHop', 'Dance'], dtype=object)

3. Calculate the accuracy of the model based on the data provided with traing at 80%.
Answer:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

music= pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosh-hamedani/python-supplementary-materials/refs/heads/main/music.csv')
X = music.drop(columns=['genre'])
y = music['genre']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions= model.predict(X_test)

score = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
score
